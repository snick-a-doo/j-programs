NB.
NB. Startup script for interactive J sessions.  The file
NB. '~.jprofile.ijs' is loaded automatically, but before the standard
NB. library.  This file should be loaded by passing it as an argument
NB. to jconsole.

NB. Use an ASCII hyphen instead of the Unicode horizontal line.  The
NB. latter is too long on Android and messes up the spacing.
NB. box_chars =: (16 + i.11) { a.
NB. 9!:7 '-' 10 } box_chars

NB. Set the load path.
load '/root/programs/J/import.ijs'
add_to_path '~/programs/J'
